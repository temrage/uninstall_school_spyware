## üìú Removing Securly

This guide will help you remove the **Securly** proxy by deleting related certificates and resetting the `AutoConfigURL` registry entry. 

### üö® Before You Begin
1. **Google Chrome users:** Immediately sign out of your school browser profile! Syncing the browser profile can force-install the Securly extension and make Chrome "managed by your organization," allowing schools to monitor your browsing history. 
   - For better privacy, consider switching to open-source browsers like **Brave**, **Firefox**, or **LibreWolf**.

### üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Remove Securly

#### 1. Remove Securly Certificates

Download and run the script below as an **administrator** to delete certificates associated with "*.securly.com" from both system and user certificate stores.

```

#### 2. Remove AutoConfigURL Registry Entry
