## 📘 Introduction

Many schools require students to complete an "initial device registration" process to connect to their network. During this process, they may install software on your personal device, such as **Mobile Device Management (MDM)** profiles or surveillance tools like **Securly**.

These tools are **not required** for network access and can invade your privacy by monitoring activities, collecting data, and restricting your device’s capabilities. This script removes these unnecessary spyware from your personal device while maintaining your ability to connect to the school network.

> ⚠️ **Note:** If you're a new student or have a new device, you can run this script or follow the steps on the SSL inspection repo to connect to the school network.

### 📱 Mobile Device Management (MDM)

**What is MDM?**  
Mobile Device Management (MDM) is software used by organizations to manage devices, allowing them to:

- Install and update apps.
- Enforce security policies.
- Monitor device usage.
- Remotely wipe or lock devices.

#### Privacy Concerns with MDM on Personal Devices
When installed on **personal devices**, MDM gives schools considerable access, including:

- Monitoring apps and data usage.
- Accessing personal information.
- Enforcing school policies, even outside school.

Despite claims that not all permissions are activated, privacy risks persist, including logging activity and sending data back to the school. The justification that MDM serves as a software repository is questionable since tools like **Adobe Creative Cloud** and **Microsoft Office 365** are freely available for download.

## 🛡️ Your Right to Privacy

> **"Privacy is a fundamental human right."**

Your personal device contains sensitive information, personal communications, and data that should remain under your control. Schools or organizations should not have the authority to manage these aspects of your life, especially without your explicit consent.

### 📜 Legal Protections

- **Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA)**: Requires explicit consent before collecting or using personal data.
- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Guarantees individuals the right to control their own data, requiring organizations to protect privacy and comply with strict data protection measures.

The installation of monitoring software or MDM on your device without your consent violates these principles and laws. You have the right to refuse such intrusions and protect your privacy.
