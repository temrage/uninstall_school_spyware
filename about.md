## Introduction

Many schools require students to complete an "initial device registration" process to connect to their network. During this process, they may install software on your personal device, such as **Mobile Device Management (MDM)** profiles or other surveillance tools like **Securly**. 

These tools are **not required** for network access and can invade your privacy by monitoring activities, collecting data, and restricting your device’s capabilities. This script will remove these unnecessary spyware from your personal device while maintaining your ability to connect to the school network.

⚠️ **If you're a new student or have a new device**, you can run this script as well or follow the steps on my SSL inspection repo so connect to the school network.

## 🎯 What will be removed?

### 🔍 **Securly Proxy**

**What is Securly Proxy?**  
Securly Proxy is a monitoring tool used by some schools to manage internet activity on students’ devices. Here's how it works and its implications:

1. **Traffic Redirection & Logging**:  
   Redirects all your internet traffic through a server in the US, logging and analyzing your activity. This slows down your connection.
   
2. **Parental Access**:  
   Parents can view your browsing history and online activity via Securly Proxy.
   
3. **Content Filtering & Blocking**:  
   Blocks access to sites deemed inappropriate by the school. Parents can also block specific sites.

4. **Monitoring Beyond School**:  
   The proxy can monitor your device even off-campus. (⚠️ Potential GDPR violation!)

5. **Wellbeing Tracking**:  
   Flags keywords related to self-harm or dangerous behavior and sends alerts to the school, raising further privacy concerns.

6. **Consent & Privacy**:  
   Schools often install Securly without explicit consent, potentially violating data protection laws like the **PDPA** and **GDPR**.

### 📱 **Mobile Device Management (MDM)**

**What is MDM?**  
Mobile Device Management (MDM) is software used by organizations to manage devices. It typically allows them to:

- **Install and update apps**.
- **Enforce security policies**.
- **Monitor device usage**.
- **Remote wipe/lock devices**.

#### MDM on Personal Devices: Privacy Concerns
When installed on **personal devices**, MDM gives schools considerable access to your device, including:

- Monitoring apps and data usage.
- Accessing personal information.
- Enforcing school policies, even outside of school.

Despite claims that not all permissions are activated, privacy risks persist, including logging your activity and sending data back to the school. The justification that MDM serves as a software repository is questionable since tools like **Adobe Creative Cloud** and **Microsoft Office 365** are freely available for download.

## 🛡️ Your Right to Privacy

> **"Privacy is a fundamental human right."**

Your personal device contains sensitive information, personal communications, and data that should be under your control. Schools or organizations should not have the authority to manage these aspects of your life, especially without your explicit consent.

### Legal Protections: 📜

- **Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA)**: Requires explicit consent before collecting or using personal data.
- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Guarantees individuals the right to control their own data, requiring organizations to protect privacy and comply with strict data protection measures.

The installation of monitoring software or MDM on your device without your consent is a violation of these principles and laws. You have the right to refuse such intrusions and protect your privacy.

## ⚖️ Conclusion

Your device is **yours to control**. Schools and institutions should respect your privacy and comply with data protection laws. This guide empowers you to regain control over your personal device, ensuring your privacy is safeguarded from unwarranted intrusions.
